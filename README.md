# ðŸ’¡ Daily Dev Features

A community-driven project where developers build and contribute one feature at a time â€” every day.

Whether it's a button with cool logic, a small API, or a reusable component â€” this is your playground to build, learn, and collaborate.

---

## ðŸš€ What is This?
This repository is a collaborative space to:
- Practice building real-world features
- Learn from others
- Grow your portfolio
- Share cool, bite-sized solutions

Every feature lives in its own folder and can be as small or as creative as you like.

---

## ðŸ›  How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo**
2. **Create a new folder** inside `features/`,named like: `feature-name_your-name`
  -Â Â Â Example: `todo-toggle_mohamed`
3. Add your code (can be in any stack â€” Node, JS, TS, etc.)
4. Add a `README.md` inside your feature folder with:
   - What it does
   - How to run it (if needed)
5. Create a **Pull Request** â€” we'll review it and merge!

âœ… Every contribution is welcome, even the smallest!
