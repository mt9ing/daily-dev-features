# ðŸ’¡ Daily Dev Features

A community-driven project where developers build and contribute one feature at a time â€” every day.

Whether it's a button with cool logic, a small API, or a reusable component â€” this is your playground to build, learn, and collaborate.

---

## ðŸš€ What is This?

This repository is a collaborative space to:

- Practice building real-world features
- Learn from others
- Grow your portfolio
- Share cool, bite-sized solutions

Every feature lives in its own folder and can be as small or as creative as you like.

## ðŸ›  How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo**
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature
3. **Create a new folder** inside `features/`
   - named like: `feature-name_your-username` (if you're just making one feature)
     - Example: `toggleButton_@mt9ing`
   - If you're planning to contribute continuously, create a folder with your username, like: `@your-username/feature-name`
     - Example: `@mt9ing/toggleButton`
4. Add your code (can be in any stack\language â€” Node, JS, TS, Python, C++ etc.)
5. Add a `README.md` inside your feature folder with:
   - What it does
   - How to run it (if needed)
6. Add your information in `Contributors/index.json`
7. Create a **Pull Request** â€” we'll review it and merge!

âœ… Every contribution is welcome, even the smallest!

## â­• NOTES: Could Help You!

0. **NOT JUST FEATUREs** you can also create anything `["whole project", "utility function", "random script", "etc..."]`
1. **Use ChatGPT** to make the feature README.md file
2. **Use snake-case** in your files and folder name for better readability
3. **Create a new folder** with your github username like: `/@mt9ing` if you're going to contribute alot in the feature
4. **For Single Feature** just create a folder like `/feature-name_@your-username`
5. **Create a new folder** for each feature you make
6. **DON'T FORGET TO** Add your information in `/Contributors/index.json` after you finish your first contribute
7. **ALSO DON'T FORGET TO EDIT IT** after making another feature by adding the feature name in the feature array in `/Contributors/index.json`
